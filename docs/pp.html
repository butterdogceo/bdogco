      any changes to such personal information.</p>
    <h2>Information automatically collected</h2>
    <p><i>In Short: Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device
        characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Website.</i></p>
    <p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or navigate the Website. This information does
      not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage
      information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences,
      referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Website and other
      technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Website,
      and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
    <b>The information we collect includes:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage and performance information our
        servers automatically collect when you access or use our Website and which we record in log files. Depending on
        how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type and
        settings and information about your activity in the Website (such as the date/time stamps associated with your
        usage, pages and files viewed, searches and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event
        information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called 'crash dumps') and hardware settings).
      </li>
      <li>Device Data. We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet or other device you
        use to access the Website. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your
        IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware
        model Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system and system configuration information.
      </li>
      <li>Location Data. We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either
        precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to
        access the Website. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us
        your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information
        either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. Note however,
        if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li>
    </ul>

        performance.</li>
      <li>To post testimonials. We post testimonials on our Website that may contain personal information. Before

        requirements or in connection with our contract.</li>
      <li>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm. If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to
        inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="3">3. Will your information be shared with anyone?</h1>
    <p><i>In Short: We only share information with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services, to
        protect your rights, or to fulfill business obligations.</i></p>
    <p><b>We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following legal basis:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consent: We may process your data if you have given us specific consent to use your personal information for a
        specific purpose.</li>

        business interests.</li>
      <li>Performance of a Contract: Where we have entered into a contract with you, we may process your personal

      <li>Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are legally required to do so in order to comply
        with applicable law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process, such as in
        response to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security
        or law enforcement requirements).</li>
      <li>Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or
        take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential
        threats to the safety of any person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are
        involved.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following
      situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of,
        any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another
        company.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="4">4. How long do we keep your information?</h1>
    <p><i>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy
        notice unless otherwise required by law.</i></p>
    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
      privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other
      legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than
      90 days.</p>
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
      anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been
      stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further
      processing until deletion is possible.</p>

    <h1 id="5">5. How do we keep your information safe?</h1>
    <p><i>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical
        security measures.</i></p>
    <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security
      of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
      electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure,
      so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be
      able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will
      do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is
      at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.</p>

    <h1 id="6">6. What are your privacy rights?</h1>
    <p><i>In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</i></p>
    <p>If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information,
      you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their
      contact details here: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm"
        class="hyperlink">https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.</p>
    <p>If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here:
      <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html"
        class="hyperlink">https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html</a>.
    </p>

    <h1 id="7">7. Controls for do-not-track features</h1>
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
      feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
      activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
      DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
      that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
      that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
      notice. At this time there is no need for a DNT feature on our web site(s) as we do not track you.</p>

    <h1 id="8">8. Do California residents have specific privacy rights??</h1>
    <p><i>In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your
        personal information.</i></p>
    <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are
      California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories
      of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and
      addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar
      year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in
      writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>
    <p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Website, you have
      the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Website. To request removal of such
      data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated
      with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly
      displayed on the Website, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from
      all our systems (e.g. backups, etc.).</p>

    <h1 id="9">9. Do we make updates do this notice?</h1>
    <p><i>In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</i></p>
    <p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
      "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes
      to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly
      sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are
      protecting your information.</p>
