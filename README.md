# What's ButterDogCo?
ButterDogCo is a company created by Keegan in 7th grade. The website began with a simple search engine on Google Sites, originally called "ButterDog Search." The site has since expanded into different areas and has eventually become what we are now. We no longer rely on Google Sites, and every new website is entirely custom-made.
